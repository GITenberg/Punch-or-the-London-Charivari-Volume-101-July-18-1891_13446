    <h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

    <h4>No. II.&mdash;TO SOCIAL AMBITION.</h4>

    <p>DEAR SIR, OR MADAM,</p>

    <p>I had not intended to annoy you with another letter. But
    since I addressed you last week I have received one or two
    communications&mdash;not from you, <i>bien entendu</i>, for you
    are too wary to dispute the accuracy of what I have written;
    but from concrete human beings, who pretend to speak on your
    behalf, and deny that I have "proved my case." I might answer
    by saying that I never set out to prove a case&mdash;that I
    wished merely to enjoy a friendly chat with you, and to appeal
    to your clemency on behalf of the large class whom I ventured
    to represent by the DABCHICKS. "But," says one of my
    detractors, in a letter now lying before me, "you have only
    given one instance. You have talked grandly about Queens, and
    Dukes, and actresses, and, in the end, you have put us off with
    a wretched story about the <i>parvenu</i> DABCHICK. For my
    part, I refuse to admit your authority until you prove, in
    greater detail, that you really know something of the subject
    on which you presumed to write." "Sir," I reply, "you are
    brusque, and somewhat offensive in the style you use towards
    me. For my part I do not admit that you are entitled to an
    answer from me, and I have felt disposed to pass you by in
    silence. But since there may be other weak vessels of your
    sort, I will do violence to myself, and pen another letter."
    And thus, my dear SOCIAL AMBITION, I once more take the liberty
    of addressing you, not without an inward tremor lest you should
    pounce upon me unawares, and cause me to expiate my rashness by
    driving me from the calm seclusion in which I spend my days, to
    mingle with the feverish throng who wrangle for place and
    precedence, myself the most feverish wrangler of them all. But,
    on the principle that we are both, in some sort, hawks, I think
    I may trust you to spare my eyes, while I remind you of one or
    two incidents in which you bore a part.</p>

        </a>
    </div>

    <p>And first BLENKINSOP knocks at the door of my memory. I bid
    him enter, and I see a tall slim youth, not ill-favoured,
    wearing well-cut clothes, and carrying a most beautiful,
    gold-topped Malacca cane delicately in his hand. He is smoking
    a cigar, and complains to me that his life is a succession of
    aimless days, and that he cannot find any employment to turn
    his hand to. That very night, I remember, he dined with me. We
    went to the play together, and afterwards looked in at Lady
    ALICIA PARBOIL's dance. Dear Lady ALICIA, how plump she was,
    and how good-natured, and how well she married her
    fiddle-headed daughters. Her husband too, that clumsy,
    heavy-witted oaf, how cunningly and how successfully withal she
    schemed for his advancement. <i>Quid plura?</i> you knew her
    well, she was devoted to you. I only speak of her to remind you
    that it was in her hospitable rooms that GERVASE BLENKINSOP met
    you&mdash;and his fate. He had danced for the second time that
    evening with ELVIRA PARBOIL, and, having returned that blushing
    virgin to her accustomed corner, was just about to depart when
    the ample form of Lady ALICIA bore down upon him: "Oh, Mr.
    BLENKINSOP," her Ladyship began, "I really cannot allow you to
    go before I introduce you to Mr. WILBRAHAM. I hear," she
    continued, "he has just lost his Private Secretary, and who
    knows but that&mdash;" Here she paused, and archly tapping her
    <i>protégé's</i> cheek with her fan, she bore him off to
    introduce him to the Cabinet Minister. I watched the ceremony.
    Something whispered to me that BLENKINSOP was lost. Must I go
    through the whole painful story? He became Private Secretary to
    his new Right Honourable friend, and from that moment he was a
    changed man. His cheery good-nature vanished. Instead of it he
    cultivated an air of pompous importance. One by one he weeded
    out his useless friends, and attached to himself dull but
    potentially useful big wigs who possessed titles and influence.
    At one of our last speaking interviews (we only nod distantly
    now when we meet), he hinted that in the next distribution of
    honours his name might be expected. It appeared, but, alas for
    gratitude, he had to satisfy himself with a paltry K.C.M.G.,
    which his wife (I forgot to say that he married ELVIRA)
    despises. He is now a disappointed man whom his friends, if he
    had any, would pity. He is getting on in life; the affectations
    he so laboriously cultivated no longer amuse. The witlings of
    his Clubs remark openly upon his ridiculous desire to pose as
    an earth-shaking personage, and when he goes home he has to
    listen to a series of bitter home-truths from the acrid ELVIRA.
    Would it not, I ask, have been better for Sir GERVASE
    BLENKINSOP, K.C.M.G., to have continued his ancient and aimless
    existence, than to have had a fallacious greatness dangled
    before his eyes to the end of his disappointed, but aspiring
    life?</p>

    <p>One more instance, and I have done. Do you remember TOMMY
    TIPSTAFF at Trinity? I do. He was, of course, a foolish youth,
    but he might have had a pleasant life in the fat living for
    which his family intended him. In his second year at the
    University, he met Sir JAMES SPOOF, an undergraduate Baronet,
    of great wealth, and dissolute habits. Poor TOMMY was dazzled
    by his new friend's specious glare and glitter, and his
    slapdash manner of scattering his money. They became
    inseparable. The same dealer supplied them with immense cigars,
    they went to race meetings, and tried to break the ring. When
    Sir JAMES wished to gamble, TOMMY was always ready to keep the
    bank. And all the time poor Mrs. TIPSTAFF, in her country home,
    was overjoyed at her darling's success in what she told me once
    was the most brilliant and remarkable set at Cambridge.</p>

    <p>Where is TOMMY now? The other day a ragged man shambled up
    to me, with a request that I should buy a box of lights from
    him. There was a familiar something about him. Could it be
    TOMMY? The question was indirectly answered, for, before I
    could extract a penny, or say a word, he looked hard at me,
    turned his head away, and made off as fast as his rickety legs
    would carry him. Most men must have had a similar experience,
    but few know, as I do, that you, my dear SOCIAL AMBITION, urged
    the wretched TOMMY to his destruction.</p>

    <p>On the whole, I dislike you. Those who obey you become the
    meanest of God's creatures.</p>

    <p>Pardon my candour, and believe me, Yours, without
    respect,</p>

    <h2>AUTHOR! AUTHOR!</h2>

    <p>LORD COLERIDGE's summing up to the Jury in the action taken
    by <i>Jones</i> (author of burlesques) v. <i>Roberts</i>
    (player of the same) was excellent common sense, a quality much
    needed in the case. Mr. JONES,&mdash;not our ENERY HAUTHOR,
    whose contempt for Burlesque generally is as well known as he
    can make it,&mdash;wrote to Mr. ARTHUR ROBERTS, formerly of the
    Music Halls and now of the legitimate Stage, styling him
    "Governor," and professed that he would "fit him to a T."
    <i>Poeta nascitur non "fit</i>."&mdash;and the born
    burlesque-versifier was true to what would probably be his
    comic version of the Latin proverb. But the inimitable ARTHUR,
    who does so much for himself on the stage, hardly required any
    extraneous help, and at last rejected the result of poor
    JONES's three months' hard labour at the Joe-Millery mill.
    This, however, was no joke to JONES, who straightway decided
    that this time he would give the inimitable ARTHUR something
    quite new in the way of a jest; and so, dropping the dialogue,
    he came to "the action," which, in this instance, was an
    action-at-law. Whatever Mr. ROBERTS may have thought of the
    words, he will hardly have considered the result of this case
    as "good business" from his own private and peculiar point of
    view. But all Dramatic Authors,&mdash;with the solitary
    exception of Mr. YARDLEY, formerly famous in the field, but now
    better known in "The Lane," at pantomime time, than to any
    Court where he has a legal right to appear in wig and
    gown,&mdash;from the smallest, who write to please a
    "Governor," up to the biggest, who write to please themselves,
    should rejoice at the decision in the case of <i>Jones</i> v.
    <i>Roberts</i>.</p>

    <p>AN OMISSION AT THE GUILDHALL LUNCHEON.&mdash;On the occasion
    of the Civic Banquet to the German EMPEROR, an Alderman,
    distinguished for his courtesy to strangers, and his
    appreciation of good dishes, especially of anything at all
    spicy, wished to know why, as a compliment to their Imperial
    guest, they had omitted "pickelhaubes" from the bill of fare?
    He had understood, from well-informed friends, that the EMPEROR
    seldom went anywhere without some "pickelhaubes," whatever they
    might be, as he himself, the worthy Alderman, had never had the
    opportunity of tasting one.</p>

    <h2>ALICE IN THUNDERLAND.</h2>

    <center>
        <i>Alice</i> ... The TH-ND-R-R. <i>White Queen</i> ...
        H-RC-RT. <i>Red Queen</i> ... CH-MB-RL-N.
    </center>

    <p>"I'll tell you what it is, your Majesty," said ALICE in a
    severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding the White
    Queen), "it'll never do to swagger about all over the place
    like that! Dignitaries have to be dignified, you know!"</p>

    <p>Everything was happening so oddly (since Thunderland had
    turned against Blunderland) that she didn't feel a bit
    surprised at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting
    close to her, one on each side. But she found it rather
    difficult to be quite civil to them&mdash;especially the White
    Queen, who had once been rather a favourite with her, but at
    whom she now never lost an opportunity of girding.</p>

    <p>"Always speak the truth," said the Red Queen (cocking her
    nose at the White)&mdash;"think before you speak&mdash;and
    <i>write it down afterwards</i>. It's safest, if you're dealing
    with <i>some</i> persons."</p>

    <p>"That's just what I complain of," said the White Queen,
    loftily. "You couldn't tell the truth&mdash;about that
    Table&mdash;if you tried with both hands."</p>

    <p>"I don't tell the truth with my <i>hands</i>," the Red Queen
    objected, icily.</p>

    <p>"Nobody said you did," said the White Queen. "Nobody said
    you told it <i>anyhow</i>. I said you couldn't if you tried.
    And you <i>don't</i> try either. So <i>there</i>!"</p>

    <p>"She's in that state of mind," said the Red Queen, "that she
    wants to deny <i>something</i>&mdash;only she doesn't know what
    to deny!"</p>

    <p>"A nasty vicious temper," the White Queen remarked; and then
    there was an uncomfortable silence for a month or two.</p>

    <p>The White Queen broke the silence by saying to the Red
    Queen, "I invite you to ALICE's Party&mdash;which <i>used</i>
    to be neutral ground&mdash;to explain, if you <i>can</i>, that
    nondescript nonsense of yours about National Councils as a
    substitute for Home Rule."</p>

    <p>The Red Queen smiled sourly, and said, "And I invite
    <i>you</i>"</p>

    <p>"I didn't know <i>I</i> was to have a Party at all," said
    ALICE. "Parties are things I don't hold with, as a rule; too
    great a tax and a tie. I like my freedom, <i>I</i> do. But, if
    I <i>am</i> to have one, I think <i>I</i> ought to invite the
    guests."</p>

    <p>"ALICE of Thunderland, you require some lessons in manners,"
    the White Queen remarked.</p>

    <p>"Manners are not taught in lessons," said ALICE. "Lessons
    teach <i>some</i> people to do sums, and things of that
    sort."</p>

    <p>"Can you do addition?" the Red Queen asked scornfully of the
    White. ("Bah, she can't do sums a <i>bit</i>!" she added,
    aside.)</p>

    <p>"She is doubtless better at <i>Division</i>," interposed
    ALICE, significantly.</p>

    <p>"Divide a State by a Statutory Parliament," said the Red
    Queen, with a derisive wink. "What's the right answer to
    that?"</p>

    <p>"Much the same as dividing a Nation by an indefinite number
    of Councils," retorted the White Queen, smartly. "Talk about
    <i>tu quoques</i>, there's one for you!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, as for that," rejoined the Red Queen, sniffing, "try
    another subtraction sum! Take a Grand Old Leader from a 'Party'
    of discredited 'Items,' and what would remain?"</p>

    <p>"Why, a Policy, of course," replied the White Queen. "And
    another Leader," she added, <i>sotto voce</i>. "Here's another
    for <i>you</i>," she pursued, aloud. "Take a Liberal-Unionist
    Tail from a Radical 'Rat,' what would remain then?"</p>

    <p>"I suppose <i>you</i> think <i>nothing</i> would remain,"
    sneered the Red Queen.</p>

    <p>"Wrong, as usual," said the White Queen; "the Rat's nasty
    temper would remain."</p>

    <p>"But I don't see how!"</p>

    <p>"Why, look here," the White Queen cried; "the Rat would lose
    its temper with its 'tail,' wouldn't it?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps it would," ALICE replied, cautiously.</p>

    <p>"Then, if the 'Rat' went away from its 'Tail,' its temper
    would remain," the White Queen exclaimed.</p>

    <p>ALICE said, as gravely as she could. "They might go
    different ways&mdash;the 'Rat,' the 'Tail,' and the 'Temper.'"
    But she couldn't help thinking to herself, "What dreadful
    nonsense we <i>are</i> talking!"</p>

    <p>THE ONLY ONE.&mdash;A ready-penning writer in his <i>Daily

    <h3>A RECITATION UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>An Evening Party</i>; Miss FRESIA
        BLUDKINSON, <i>a talented young Professional Reciter, has
        been engaged to entertain the company, and is about to
        deliver the favourite piece entitled, "The Lover of Lobelia
        Bangs, a Cowboy Idyl." There is the usual crush, and the
        guests outside the drawing-room, who can neither hear nor
        see what is going on, console themselves by conversing in
        distinctly audible tones. Jammed in a doorway, between the
        persons who are trying to get in, and the people who would
        be only too glad to get out, is an</i> Unsophisticated
        Guest <i>who doesn't know a soul, and is consequently
        reduced to listening to the Recitation. This is what he
        hears:&mdash;</i></p>

    <p>Haven't time to send you much information this week, as
    We,&mdash;the firm of Self and Corresponding
    Captain,&mdash;have had to write rather a heavy packet for the
    Daily Graphic. I suppose you will have got Herr Von GERMAN
    EMPEROR with you by the time you receive this from yours truly;
    or His Imperialness may have quitted your,&mdash;that is, our,

    of Hospitable Shores, remember me to the most hospitable of all
    Shores&mdash;Captain SHAW&mdash;of the Fire-and-Water Brigade.
    My companions&mdash;"Jolly companions everyone"&mdash;the
    Cautious Captain, or the Wily WILLIAMS, Doubting Doctor,
    Energetic Engineer, all well. Wily WILLIAMS hard at his MS.,
    giving an account of the "agricultural and mineral resources"
    of the What-can-the-Matterbeland, "through the instrumentality
    of the Chartered Company." He's great at this. Think I shall
    start new Company&mdash;"The Chartered Libertine." If my memory
    doesn't fail me, that's a Shakspearian title. But who was the
    "Chartered Libertine"? I notice these South-African States are
    independent of Home Government. 'Pon my word, I fancy W.E.G.
    was right about Home Rule. On whose shoulders can the G.O.M.'s
    mantle fall, without enveloping him in entire obscurity, except
    on those of the Leader or the once united, but now fractured
    <i>quartette</i> party, "<i>quorum pars magna fui</i>?" I still

    <h4>CAPERS.</h4>

    <p>No wonder we've had so many dancing parties at the Cape,
    when all the inhabitants are Capers. I make this a present to
    my dear old DRUMMY; he can bring it out in his new Persian
    <i>Joe Miller</i>. Cheeky little street-boys give you Capers'
    sauce. They can lead you a pretty dance if you chivy them.</p>

    <h4>AMUSEMENTS OF THE BOERS.</h4>

    <p>To-day came across a Peep-Boer-Show. Seen it all before.
    Also a kind of Punch-and-Judy performance going on, translated
    into South-African dialect. There was not a paying public to
    witness it; and, with all my desire and with every intention to
    encourage native talent, I was compelled to turn away, "more in
    sorrow than in anger," (SHAKSPEARE again&mdash;<i>Hamlet's
    Ghost</i>, I think,) when the pipe-and-drummer man came to me
    for a contribution. Not a penny in my pocket. "I will reimburse
    thee nobly," said I, "on my return from the Mine-land." He
    quoted some line or other, which I did not catch, and gave the
    name of the writer, one "WALKER," as his authority. WALKER is
    associated in my mind with an English Dictionary, but, though
    it has been much added to in recent years, I doubt whether the
    words the Showman used on this occasion can be found in my
    pocket edition, or in any other edition of that excellent and
    trustworthy compilation.</p>

    <h4>CHANGE OF HAIR.</h4>

    <p>Called at native barber's to-day. Gave him no instructions.
    Thought of course he was going to cut it; and so fell asleep. I
    almost always fall asleep when under the mesmeric influence of
    a capillary administrator. I should like him to keep on doing
    it; cut and comb again. So soothing! Woke up and found
    myself&mdash;like this. (<i>See Hair Cut.</i>) Herewith please
    receive portrait, and treasure it.</p>

    <h4>ARMA VIRUMQUE.</h4>

    <p>Must send you a sketch of some of our B.B.B.'s or the Bold
    Bobbies of Basuto all armed. Ha! ha! as dear old WOLFFY would
    have said, "I was quite <i>all-armed</i> at seeing this!" Hope
    to be on the track of TOM TIDDLER's ground very soon. But
    anyhow till I am <i>sur la tache</i>, "on the spot," any one of
    these letters of mine (emphasis on the "mine") of which all are
    genuine&mdash;"proofs before letters" you have in my signed
    promise&mdash;is well worth a hundred pounds, and cheap at the
    price. It's my note of hand in exchange for the cash,&mdash;for
    the "ready ay ready!" as we say at sea. Away to the fields of
    gold!</p>

    <h4>PROSPECTING POSSIBILITIES.</h4>

    <p>N.B.&mdash;Rather think I am going to call on Queen ZAMBILI
    this afternoon. Ahem! Do you remember the ballads of "<i>My
    heart is true to Poll</i>," and "<i>The King of the
    Owyhees</i>"? Again, ahem! "Black Queen to mate in three
    moves." Of course, can't go in for this sort of thing myself,
    but by deputy, eh? Representative Government and King PROXY THE
    FIRST, with myself for Prime Minister. How's that Empire?

    <p>After considerable calculation as to re-imbursement for
    present outlay by a consistent course of future economy, I took
    a six-guinea stall for the EMPEROR's state visit to the Opera.
    "Court dress" being "indispensable," I decided to summon to my
    aid the well-known amateur theatrical costumier, DATHAN &amp;
    Co. DATHAN sees at a glance what I want. He measures me with
    his eye. "Co." in waiting is dispatched to bring down two or
    three Court suits. In less than ten minutes I am perfectly
    fitted, that is, in DATHAN's not entirely disinterested but
    still highly artistic opinion, with which "Co." unhesitatingly
    agrees. For my own part, as a mere lay-figure, I should have
    preferred the continuations being a trifle less tight round the
    knee; also if the coat were a little easier about the
    shoulders, and not quite so baggy in the back I should breathe
    more freely; and, while we are on the subject, the collar might
    be lower, as it is in close proximity to the lobes of my ears
    and irritatingly tickles me. The white waistcoat&mdash;"well,"
    as "Co.," in the absence of DATHAN, rapturously observes,
    "might ha' been made for yer!" "It might," true: but it
    certainly wasn't, as it is somewhat long, and there's a little
    shyness on the part of the last button but one in meeting the
    button-hole with which it ought to be on the best possible
    terms. But sharp-eyed little "Co." sees his way out of the
    difficulty; he hoists up the collar, he adjusts pins in the
    back, and, in a second, button and hole are in each other's
    embrace. The coat-collar can be taken in and done
    for&mdash;"nothing easier," says the undaunted Co.&mdash;and
    the part across my manly chest can be let out,&mdash;of course
    not a difficulty, as the whole suit, will be "let out" for the
    evening.</p>

    <p>I am generally satisfied with my appearance in the glass as
    a portrait of a gentleman in repose, but I feel that any
    display of emotion, even of irrepressible loyalty, would
    probably be disastrous to some portion of my attire. The Court
    sword, too, is rather embarrassing, and, though Co. has
    adroitly fixed it for me by some mysterious process of
    invisible arrangement, yet, when I shall be left alone with the
    sheathed weapon, and have to do all this buckling and hitching
    for myself, I feel sure that that sword, which is only worn on
    the left to defend the right, will give me no inconsiderable
    trouble. Fortunately our washerwoman's husband, who comes late
    on a Wednesday for the linen, is a retired sergeant, and knows
    how this sort of thing should be done. He will assist in arming
    me for the operatic fray. <i>Tout va bien.</i></p>

    <p><i>At Opera, Wednesday Night, July 8</i>.&mdash;Grand sight.
    Very grand; not only that, but beautiful. Costumes, uniforms,
    military, diplomatic,&mdash;all sorts, the real article and the
    Dathanic,&mdash;impossible to tell one from the other, taking
    them as a lot; but still, I feel that it is better to remain in
    my Stall, where only the upper part of me is visible to the
    unclothed eye. The consciousness that I am here, not as myself,
    but in disguise as somebody else, name unknown, rather
    oppresses me; only at first, however, as very soon I recognise
    a number of familiar faces and figures all in strange array. A
    stockbroker or two, a few journalists, several ordinary people
    belonging to various callings and professions, some others
    noble, some gentle, some simple, but most of us eyeing each
    other furtively, and wondering where the deuce the other fellow
    got his costume from, and what right he has to wear it.</p>

    <p>Every moment I expect some gaily attired person to come up
    and say to me confidentially, "I know that suit; I wore it last
    so-and-so. Isn't it a trifle tight about the shoulders? Beware!
    when I wore it, it went a bit in the back." Man in gorgeous
    uniform makes his way to the vacant Stall next to me. I am a
    bit flustered until he salutes me heartily with&mdash;"How d'ye
    do? How are you?" Why, it's&mdash;well, no matter who it is. I
    have met him everywhere for years; we are the best of friends.
    I knew he is something; somewhere in the City, but not much
    anywhere else, and at all events he is no more a military man
    than I am a courtier, but when he confides to me that he was
    once upon a time in the Dampshire Yeomanry, and that this
    uniform has served him for years, and looks uncommonly well at
    night though it wouldn't bear the light of day, I begin to
    comprehend the entire scene.</p>

    <p>My friend&mdash;we will call him TOMMY TUCKER, (for I have
    frequently encountered him at supper, and am aware of his
    capacity)&mdash;is full of information. Some of our neighbours
    of an inquiring turn are asking one another who <i>that</i> is,
    and who <i>this</i> is, and so forth; and when the answers are
    incorrect, or even before the answers can be given, TOMMY
    TUCKER has replied in a low voice, with a view to imparting
    general information gratis, that So-and-So, in scarlet and
    silver, is Mr. BLACKSTONE, of BLACKSTONE &amp; SONS, head of
    the great Coal Merchant Firm; that the man in blue and silver,
    supposed to be a Hungarian <i>attaché</i>, is the junior
    partner in BUNNUMS &amp; Co., the Big Cake Purveyor; and that
    the warlike person, with a jingling sabre, is not a Prussian
    officer, but is Deputy JONES, in the gorgeous uniform of the
    Old Buckshire Yeomanry; and when he's in the City, where he
    began in the usual way that millionnaires always do begin, by
    sweeping out an office, he is simply JONES, of Messrs. BROWN,
    JONES, ROBINSON &amp; Co., Wharfingers. TOMMY TUCKER knows
    everybody, and everything about everybody, too. Who is that
    lady with a splendid tiara of diamonds?&mdash;that is the
    Duchess of BURLINGTON, "who"&mdash;and here, in a semi-whisper,
    intended for everybody's information, he tells how those
    brilliants come out for "one night only," and how they will be
    called for to-morrow morning by a confidential agent from
    POPSHOPPER's Establishment in the Great Loan Land. TOM TUCKER
    is full of these stories. There isn't a person he doesn't know,
    until happening to recognise here a one and there a one, I
    correct him of my own private and personal knowledge, when he
    frankly admits that I am right; and after casually explaining
    how he does occasionally mistake the Countess of DUNNOYER for
    Lady ELIZABETH MARTIN, he goes off at a tangent, and picks out
    several other distinguished-looking personages, numbering them
    as "first to right," "second to left," and so forth, as if in a
    collection of wax-works, giving to each one of them a name and
    a history. His acquaintance with the private life of the
    aristocracy and the plutocracy is so extensive that I can only
    wonder at his knowledge, his or marvel at wondrous powers of
    ready invention.</p>

        </a>Birds can sing, but wouldn't sing, and couldn't be made
        to sing, at Covent Garden, Wednesday, July 8.
    </div>

    <p>So it goes on. Then enter the chief characters. All rise;
    the orchestra plays the "<i>National Anthem</i>," in German,
    suppose, out of compliment to our Imperial visitors; and
    afterwards in English (translated, and, I fancy, "transposed"),
    in honour of H.R.H. the Prince and Princess. All the wax-work
    figures form in a row, under the direction of Lord Chamberlain
    LATHOM; the machinery is put in motion; they all bow to the
    audience; glasses are riveted on them; everybody is craning and
    straining to get a good view; the people in the gallery and
    just over the Royal Box loyally enjoy the scene, being quite
    unable to see any of the distinguished persons who are, in this
    instance, "quite beneath their notice." And then Signor
    MANCINELLI turns his back on everybody, and gets to
    business.</p>

    <p>After this, I feel that a buckle, somewhere or other, has
    turned traitor, and inventing an excuse with a readiness worthy
    of TOMMY TUCKER himself, I suddenly, but cautiously, retire. I
    descend the grand staircase between two rows of beefeaters
    reclining drowsily at their ease. Fast asleep, some of 'em,
    after too much beef. Imagine myself a prisoner, in disguise of
    course, escaping from the Tower in the olden time. Then,
    fearing the collapse of another buckle or button, or the sudden
    "giving" of a seam, I steal cautiously past the
    Guards&mdash;then past serried ranks of soldiers under the
    colonnade&mdash;then&mdash;once more in the street of Bow, and
    I am free! I breathe again.</p>

    <p>Hie thee home, my gallant steed (an eighteenpenny fare in a
    hansom), and let me resume the costume of private life, trifle
    with a cutlet, drain the goblet and smoke the mild havannah.

    <h2>IMPERIAL IMPRESSIONS.</h2>

    <p>That they are not accustomed to ultra punctuality in the
    arrival of steam-yachts at Port Victoria.</p>

    <p>That some one ought to catch it for not looking after the
    water-pipes in the State dining-room.</p>

    <p>That it is rather trying to have to remain dignified with
    your boots in three inches of water.</p>

    <p>That the Eton Volunteers are just the sort of boys to follow
    the tradition of the past, and win a second Waterloo.</p>

    <p>That still it was a little awkward to have to review them in
    the pauses of a thunderstorm.</p>

    <p>That the wedding as a wedding was not bad, but a couple of
    hundred thousand troops or so posted as a guard of honour,
    would have made it more impressive.</p>

    <p>That Buckingham Palace is rather <i>triste</i>, when it is
    populated on the scale of one inhabitant to the square
    mile.</p>

    <p>That Covent Garden Opera House, decorated with leagues of
    flower wreaths, is the finest sight in the world.</p>

    <p>That Sheriff AUGUSTUS GLOSSOP HARRIS deserves a dukedom,
    and, if he were a German, should have it.</p>

    <p>That one State Ball is like every other, but still it was
    very well done on Friday.</p>

    <p>That the visit to the City was an entire success (although I

    <p><i>Marks.</i> Another time, but just now moments are

    pleasant days in the old place?</p>

    <p><i>Marks.</i> Did we? I daresay we did.</p>

    <p><i>Loung.</i> Why, of course! Grand old days! Don't you
    remember what fun it used to be decorating your tent; and then,
    when the ladies came down&mdash;which they did nearly all the
    day long&mdash;what larks it was getting them tea and
    claret-cup?</p>

    <p><i>Marks.</i> Very likely. But we don't have many ladies

    <p><i>Loung.</i> Well, you <i>are</i> a chap! Why, how can

    <p><i>Marks.</i> (<i>unbending</i>). Very kind of you, but, my

    <p><i>Loung.</i> Why, at Wimbledon you had nothing to do!</p>

    <p><i>Marks.</i> Very likely. But then Bisley isn't
    Wimbledon.</p>

    <p><i>Loung.</i> (<i>dryly</i>). So it seems. Everyone said
    that, when they moved the camp further away from home, they
    would ruin the meeting.</p>

    <p><i>Marks.</i> Then everyone was wrong. Why, we are going on
    swimmingly.</p>

    <p><i>Loung.</i> It must be beastly dull.</p>

    <p><i>Marks.</i> My dear fellow, figures are the best test of
    that. In all the history of the Association we have never had
    more entries than this year.</p>

    <p><i>Loung.</i> That may be, but you don't have half the fun

    <p><i>Marks.</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Don't want to! Business, my

    <p><i>House of Commons. Monday, July 6</i>.&mdash;Don't know
    what the House of Lords would do without WEMYSS. How the House
    of Commons gets along without ELCHO is another story. Of course
    we are not absolutely ELCHO-less. Amurath has succeeded to
    Amurath, and there is still an ELCHO in the Commons. Perhaps in
    time he may reach the towering height of his illustrious
    father. He does very well as it is; made exceedingly smart
    speech the other afternoon on adjournment over Derby Day. We
    try to bear up; make the best of things; but in our secret
    hearts confess that this century has seen but one Lord ELCHO,
    and now he's Earl of WEMYSS.</p>

    <p>Was in fine old style to-night. DORCHESTER brought on
    question of Volunteers. They are going to Wimbledon on Saturday
    to be reviewed by that veteran the German EMPEROR. DORCHESTER,
    in modest, convincing speech, pointed out how unfair it was
    that, in addition to, in many cases, losing a day's pay, in all
    cases incurring a day's hard work, that Volunteers should be
    required to pay expenses of their trip to Wimbledon. DORCHESTER
    left nothing unsaid; put the whole case in brief speech. But
    WEMYSS not going to be left out. Interposed in fine patronising
    manner; made acknowledgment of DORCHESTER's good intention;
    but, suggesting an absolutely imaginary case, took exception to
    the presentation of the Volunteers in the light of asking for a
    day's pay. That, he said, would spoil the whole case.</p>

    <p>No one had suggested anything of the kind. WEMYSS had
    brought this nine-pin in with him as if it were one of a set of
    baccarat counters, had set it up, and was now knocking it down.
    Noble Lords sat and stared in polite amazement. CRANBROOK, in
    his impetuous way, jumped up and raised point of order. WEMYSS
    put him aside with sweep of sword-arm, and went on to end of
    his speech, which showed who was the true friend of the
    Volunteer forces.</p>

    <p>"Ah," said young LAMINGTON, second Baron, regarding with
    pleased interest the flush of satisfaction that mantled WEMYSS'
    brow when he resumed his seat, "this House would have been
    nothing only for us fellows coming in from the Commons. It's
    new blood that does it. I'll make them a speech myself some
    day."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Quite a lot in the Commons.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;FERGUSSON says life at Foreign Office
    would be endurable only for LABBY. The Sage has got the Triple
    Alliance on the brain; spends his mornings in drafting
    questions there anent. That FERGUSSON wouldn't mind so much,
    only it involves his spending <i>his</i> afternoons in drafting
    answers that shall look coherent, and yet say nothing. Answers
    often so admirably suited to their purpose, that doubts arise
    as to whether a firmer hand than FERGUSSON's has not traced
    them on paper. "A dull man," was the phrase in which, years
    ago, JOHN BRIGHT dismissed from consideration the statesman
    then known as Sir CHARLES ADDERLY. To House of Commons
    FERGUSSON is a dull man, incapable, as it seems, of framing
    these subtle answers that look as if they meant so much, and
    yet say so little.</p>

    <div class="figleft"

             alt="Sage of Queen Anne's Gate." /></a>Sage of Queen
             Anne's Gate.
    </div>

    <p>Whoever be the author, it must be said that FERGUSSON
    contributes to success of answers by his manner of reading
    them. So portentous is his gravity, so like a stone wall his
    imperturbability, that the Sage dashes himself up against it
    with much the same effect as if he were attacking one of the
    buttresses of Westminster Hall. It is a fortuitous
    concatenation of circumstances, most happy in its result, that
    when in the House of Commons an answer is to be given which
    shall convey no information, the MARKISS should dictate it, and
    FERGUSSON recite it. If, in reply to the Sage's question
    to-night, as to the understanding between this country and
    Italy with respect to the <i>status quo</i> in Mediterranean,
    FERGUSSON had stood up and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> recited the multiplication
       table up to twelve times twelve, the remarks would have been
       just as relevant and informing as those he read from the
       paper. Moreover, the gravity of his aspect and the solemn
       inflection of his voice, would have compelled Members to
       listen to the end of the recitation with a sort of dim
       consciousness that they were really being informed as to the
       details of an understanding come to between Her majesty's
       Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the Governments
       of Germany and Italy.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Education Bill through Report
    Stage.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;House having disposed of Land
    Purchase Bill and Education Bill, is able to devote portion of
    sitting to consideration of its own personal affairs. MORTON
    brings on subject of Bar in Lobby of House of Commons. Nothing
    to do with the Bar that LOCKWOOD, ASQUITH, and REID adorn;
    merely a counter, at which they sell what JEMMY LOWTHER alludes
    to, with a bewitching air of distant acquaintance, as
    "alcoholic liquors." MORTON, whose great ambition in life is to
    make people thoroughly comfortable, wants to close the Bar.
    SYDNEY HERBERT, making a rare appearance as spokesman for the
    Government on the Treasury Bench, pleads as a set-off against
    alleged evil example, the large consumption of "lemon squash,"
    which he explains to the House is "a non-intoxicant."
    CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN sends thrill of apprehension through
    listening Senate by inquiring whether the House of Commons is
    licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquors?</p>

    <p>No one every thought of that before. As far an anyone knows,
    place isn't licensed; consequently, in very birthplace of
    legislation, the law has for years been systematically defied.
    Worse this than what happened at Temple the other day, when
    LORD CHANCELLOR and a score of principal Members of Bar of
    England narrowly escaped indictment for playing a drama in an
    unlicensed hall. Vision conjured up the police making sudden
    descent on the House, walking off with SPEAKER,
    SERGEANT-AT-ARMS, and possibly OLD MORALITY, to nearest
    station, there to be locked up till released on bail.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/36.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/36.png"
             alt="Jemmy Lowther." /></a>Jemmy, J.P.
    </div>

    <p>JEMMY LOWTHER much struck by suggestion. His innate
    magisterial instincts on the alert. We all know and like JEMMY,
    but few of us have opportunity of seeing him at his very best.
    That happens when he sits on the Magisterial Bench and
    dispenses justice. It is as JEMMY, J.P., he rises to the
    fullest height of his judicial manner. Still, pretty well just
    now. A little embarrassed at the outset by consciousness that
    his postal address at Leeds is "Swillington House." Afraid some
    ribald person will remember this, and vulgarly connect it with
    the discussion. Delightful to observe the way in which he
    reproved GEORGE CAMPBELL for language unbecoming the precincts
    of the Court. CAMPBELL had lightly spoken about "Members
    requiring a pick-me-up." "Persons enjoying the privilege of
    obtaining alcoholic liquors," was the way JEMMY put it, with a
    severe glance towards the abashed Knight of Kircaldy.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Committee of Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Turns out to-night that MORTON doesn't
    approve the Triple Alliance. This would be awkward, in any
    circumstances. Peculiarly embarrassing just now with one of the
    principal signatories our guest. Emperor WILLIAM, was most
    anxious to come down to House; meant to see everything whilst
    he was here, not knowing what may happen before another
    opportunity presents itself.</p>

    <p>"Always read your Diary, TOBY," he said to me, over a
    strawberry and cream at Marlborough House yesterday; "gather
    from it the impression that House of Commons is exceedingly
    interesting place; all its Members eloquent, and all its
    Ministers virtuous. Must go and see it. Look in on Friday."</p>

    <p>Here's a go! Known beforehand that MORTON meant to state his
    views on the MARKISS's foreign policy, with its evident leaning
    toward Germany. Very awkward if EMPEROR came in just while
    MORTON was speaking.</p>

    <p>"It would play the doose with the <i>ententy cordially</i>,"
    said JULIUS 'ANNIBAL PICTON, who resents MORTON's interference
    in the field of foreign policy.</p>

    <p>Happily Emperor WILLIAM didn't get as far as Westminster;
    detained at Guildhall; just got off in time to dine with the
    Great DOOK, and afterwards to the ball at Buckingham Palace. So
    peace between to great nations is maintained. But MORTON ran us
    pretty close. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Committee of

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
